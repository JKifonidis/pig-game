Greetings and welcome to my repository!

My implementation of the game logic based on a provided UI.
It's a part of the course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!" created by Jonas Schmedtmann. The course is available on Udemy and I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn JavaScript and web development.

Link to the game at GitHub Pages:
